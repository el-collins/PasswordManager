Project Description: Password Manager with Tkinter GUI

This project implements a simple Password Manager with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, a standard Python GUI toolkit. The program allows users to generate secure passwords and save their website, email, and password information.

Features:

Password Generation: The application provides a "Generate Password" button that generates a secure random password with a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. The generated password is displayed in the GUI and automatically copied to the clipboard for easy use.

Data Storage: Users can input their website, email, and password information into the provided entry fields. Upon clicking the "Add" button, the entered data is saved to a file named "data.txt." The file is formatted with each entry on a new line, containing the website, email, and password separated by '|' characters.

User Validation: The program validates user entries, ensuring that all fields are filled before proceeding. If any field is left empty, an error message is displayed, prompting the user to complete all required information.

User Confirmation: Before saving the entered data, the program prompts the user with a confirmation dialog, ensuring that they intend to proceed with the save operation.

User-Friendly Interface: The GUI includes entry fields for website, email, and password, making it easy for users to input and manage their credentials. Additionally, the program displays a logo image to enhance visual appeal.

Usage Instructions:

Input the website, email, and password details.
Optionally, use the "Generate Password" button to create a secure random password.
